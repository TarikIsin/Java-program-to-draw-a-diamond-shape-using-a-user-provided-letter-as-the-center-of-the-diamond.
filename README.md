# Java-program-to-draw-a-diamond-shape-using-a-user-provided-letter-as-the-center-of-the-diamond.

  This Java code asks the user to input a single letter and then prints a diamond shape consisting of letters starting from 'A' and ending with the input letter. The diamond shape is created using dots and letters, with each row containing an odd number of letters and an increasing number of dots as the letters approach the middle row. The code also checks for invalid input, such as input longer than one letter, and prints an error message.
